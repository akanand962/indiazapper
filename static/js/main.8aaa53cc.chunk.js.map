It is used to mobilize lymph systems and\r\n            ill pathogens (parasites, bacteria, virus, fungi, yeast etc.) hidden\r\n            in the body. Pulsar kills the parasites living your body with the\r\n            help of magnetic pulse.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>How to use pulsar?</strong>\r\n            Like Zapper, Pulsar is also used to kill harmful viruses, bacteria,\r\n            fungi and parasites, tapeworm, ringworm, roundworm etc. hidden in\r\n            the body. The zappers shown in the picture (Indian zapper delux)\r\n            when put on the pulsar mode, it creates a 50% duty cycle square wave\r\n            (non-sinusoidal wave) of double voltages of +30V and -30V. You can\r\n            use it at frequencies of 4Hz, 16Hz and 100 Hz respectively. To kill\r\n            parasites, use pulsar at all three frequencies for 10-10 minutes\r\n            each for approx. 30 minutes, three times a day. You can use the coil\r\n            attached with pulsar anywhere on the body, except head and face.\r\n            Pulsar can be used at body parts where the current of the Zapper\r\n            doesn't reach and parasites such as lymph system, stomach and\r\n            intestines can be killed.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <button className=\"btn btn-success\">Buy Now</button>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=' container description'>\r\n      <h3>Description</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span>Parasite cleanse with Zapper</span>\r\n          Zapper is an electric tool, which generates a fixed (but very low)\r\n          volume of current. Many recent studies reveal that applying minute (9\r\n          volt or lesser) current directly on the human body kills different\r\n          types of viruses and parasites and evicts out of the body through the\r\n          waste removal system of the body. Eviction of such parasites increases\r\n          the immune system of the body to a surprising extent. Consequently, we\r\n          recover very fast. We start feeling entirely fresh.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          It is notable that the negative \"ions\" built from electrical current\r\n          (or magnet current) do this important job of killing parasites. Zapper\r\n          works on this principle only. In the zapping process when electric\r\n          current is applied on the body, the cysts of the parasites hidden in\r\n          safe places of the body get the shock and they start dying. They turn\r\n          into micro particles and their elements, which are beneficial for the\r\n          body, gets absorbed and harmful.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Elements, such as gall-bladder stones etc. are expelled from the body\r\n          through the waste removal process.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>How does Zapper work?</strong>\r\n          Every living being realizes its existence through dissemination of\r\n          different frequencies just like frequencies that get aired from radio\r\n          stations. Zapper creates a frequency that equals the frequency of the\r\n          parasites hidden in the body, and thus kills them by making them\r\n          inactive. The current generated by Zapper is only as much as it is\r\n          necessary to kill parasites. It doesn't do any harm to the human body.\r\n          You can zap at frequencies of 2128 Hz, 10 KHz or 30 KHz in the Zapper\r\n          given here. Every frequency has been set for seven minutes in the\r\n          machine; which it can be zapped upon.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The current released at a fixed voltage and frequency by Zapper makes\r\n          the parasites numb, which affects their capacity to hide from white\r\n          blood cells. Thus it becomes easy for the white blood cells to find\r\n          them. They treat them as foreign objects that are harmful to the body,\r\n          hence, attack on them and kills them whether they are parasites or\r\n          bacteria; or viruses or fungi! This complete process of Zapper takes\r\n          approx. an hour of time. After that, the white blood cells surround\r\n          these dead foreign objects and expel them out of the body through\r\n          urine or stool.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          How to zap? <strong>How to zap?</strong>\r\n          Take two cotton clothes or napkins before starting the zap process.\r\n          Rinse them in salt mixed water. Roll each of these cotton clothes\r\n          drenched in salty water on each of the copper pies. It makes the flow\r\n          of the electric current better. Besides, the current generated by the\r\n          Zapper is so low that it would hardly reach the body if the clothes\r\n          are not drenched in salty water.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Thus, you get ready for zapping and attach the Zapper with electricity\r\n          through a power source.  Now switch on the power of the Zapper. \r\n          Hold one copper pipe in each hand tightly, as shown in the picture.\r\n          Remember - the copper pipes should not touch each other.  Hold both\r\n          of these pipes like that for seven minutes and zap at a frequency of\r\n          2180 Hz.  Now interchange copper pipes of each hand means shift the\r\n          pipe of the left hand to the right hand and the pipe of the right hand\r\n          to the left.  Again, hold both the pipes tightly for seven minutes\r\n          and zap at a frequency of 2180 Hz.  Now switch off the power of the\r\n          Zapper. Leave the copper pipes and let both the hands rest for seven\r\n          minutes, drench the napkins/cotton clothes again in saltwater and\r\n          rinse them well.  Again switch on the power of Zapper, and zap for a\r\n          new frequency of 10KHZ for seven minutes.  Interchange the copper\r\n          pipes in both the hands and zap again on 10KHZ frequency for seven\r\n          minutes.  Again, take a break for seven minutes as earlier and zap at\r\n          a new frequency of 30KHZ for two rounds of seven minutes each. It will\r\n          be the third and last set of your zapping process.  Exercise the\r\n          entire process thrice a day, for seven days.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          {\" \"}\r\n          <strong>Note:</strong> I have zapped the copper pipes on my armpits,\r\n          neck, tongue, knee and ankles too and have observed better results.\r\n          Actually, the skin of these parts of the body being soft, current\r\n          flows in the blood more effectively.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Why should it be zap thrice every day?</strong>\r\n          Many small parasites and innumerable viruses are hidden in the large\r\n          parasites present in the human body. When we zap the first time, it,\r\n          of course, kills the large parasites but the parasites, egg, larva and\r\n          pupa within these parasites stay unaffected by the electricity and\r\n          come out after some time.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Zapping twice and thrice kills egg, larva and pupa completely with\r\n          small parasites. Therefore, it is advised to zap thrice every day, at\r\n          different times.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            {\" \"}\r\n            Parasite cleanse with Colloidal Silver (Silver water)\r\n          </strong>\r\n          Parasite cleanse with Colloidal Silver (Silver water) Colloidal Silver\r\n          is made by mixing micro silver particles into water. Colloidal are\r\n          minute particles of the mettle which, after mixing in any liquid\r\n          matter (such as water), neither dissolve nor develop any ionic\r\n          compound. These microparticles of silver do not drown in the water but\r\n          keep floating. Generally ionic silver, silver colloidal, ionic silver\r\n          compound or silver protein present in pure water is called colloidal\r\n          silver. It is absolutely pure silver mixed water.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Medicinal use of silver</strong>\r\n          Silver compounds have been used as a medicine since ancient times.\r\n          Liquid form of silver nitrate was used for the first time in 1880 to\r\n          protect eyes of newborns from infection. Silver creams have been in\r\n          use as antibiotics in burn and trauma centers globally for more than a\r\n          hundred years. It is used very much in Ayurvedic and Unani medicines\r\n          too. Colloidal silver of 5PPM* (Particles Per Million) density or more\r\n          is very effective in killing infectious bacteria. Till before 1938,\r\n          allopathic doctors used colloidal silver very much as an antibiotic.\r\n          It was effective but costly too. Therefore, by the fourth-fifth decade\r\n          of the 20th century, Sulfa-drugs, penicillin etc. were put to use,\r\n          which were economical and faster in effect on patients.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>How does Colloidal Silver work?</strong>\r\n          When fungi, virus, bacteria and other single cell pathogens come into\r\n          contact with colloidal silver, it deactivates their oxygen metabolism\r\n          capacity. Pathogen dies within a few minutes after it and expelled out\r\n          of the body through the immune system, lymph gland and other waste\r\n          removal organs of the body.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            How colloidal silver is better than modern antibiotics?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          Modern antibiotics kill even enzymes beneficial for the body while\r\n          silver colloidal affects only single cell pathogens. Another drawback\r\n          of conventional antibiotics is that its ever use changes composition\r\n          and jeans of single cell bacteriaand they draw power from resistance\r\n          from antibiotics. Not any form of colloidal silver or silver does so\r\n          and bacteria get killed completely. Another peculiarity of colloidal\r\n          silver is that it does not react with any other medicine in any\r\n          manner. Therefore other necessary medicines can also be consumed along\r\n          with it. Colloidal Silver does not create any toxin in the body. It\r\n          does not react with anything except with enzymes that assist in oxygen\r\n          metabolism process of oxygen.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Dose</strong>In order to kill parasites and pathogens out of\r\n          the body, start taking 50ml of colloidal silver every day. After four\r\n          days, make it 20ml for six weeks. Dose can be reduced depending upon\r\n          weight (specially in case of children). After that, repeat the same\r\n          procedure after an interval of a few days. For a good and healthy\r\n          physique this exercise should be practiced for lifelong; with some\r\n          breaks in between. This is the best medicinal and life-saving tonic in\r\n          the world.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          In order to kill parasites and pathogens out of the body, start taking\r\n          50ml of colloidal silver every day.

It gets\r\n          absorbed by the intestines. After that it reaches cells through blood.\r\n          Within 3-4 days, the volume of silver grows so much in the tissues\r\n          that it can start work repairing cells and free the body of parasites.\r\n          It takes the kidney and lymph system 3-4 days to expel the silver\r\n          deposited in tissues out of the body which is sufficient time to show\r\n          its therapeutic effect on the body.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Colloidal silver is very effective not only in treatment but also in\r\n          the prevention of the diseases.Its intake can save you from cold, flu\r\n          infections caused by bacteria, virus, fungi etc. and other ailments\r\n          which you don't know of. You must have heard that kings and\r\n          Shekh-Nawabs stayed young forever. Silver was one of the reasons. They\r\n          always ate their food in silver pots. Thus their body used to get a\r\n          constant supply of silver, which kept their bodies protected from\r\n          diseases. Their bodies did not have to spend energy on combating with\r\n          ailments and it was used to keep the body healthy instead. We might\r\n          not know which infection we might catch in this crowded age.\r\n          Therefore, regular intake of colloidal silver works as a safety guard\r\n          for you.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Every year people get infected with different types of infections by\r\n          consuming contaminated water. Mixing only 50ml colloidal silver can\r\n          clean five liters of water.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Whether it is a sinus related problem or sore throat or blocked\r\n          nostrils; or infection of an infant's eyes – colloidal silver is fully\r\n          safe and beneficial in all these conditions. Using it externally on\r\n          skin problems such as itching, eczema, burns, cuts, boils etc. cures\r\n          them faster. Bacteria is a big reason behind body odor. This problem\r\n          can be cured by spraying silver water. Use of colloidal silver is a\r\n          perfect remedy for burn wounds. It not only fills the wound faster but\r\n          also reduces signs of burn. Regular use of colloidal silver can save\r\n          you from different types of severe infections, and stay young for long\r\n          in fact.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Product Quality</strong>\r\n          The best colloidal silver is the one which is made without any\r\n          chemical reaction, i.e. the one made from colloidal silver maker. In\r\n          this process silver particles remain in water but do not dissolve.\r\n          Pure colloidal silver is cloudy white in color (like white cloud).\r\n          Therapeutic quality of silver water depends upon its PPM (density).\r\n          Colloidal silver of three or five PPM is as effective in killing germs\r\n          as the densest silver water is.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong> Conclusion</strong>\r\n          Parasites germinate and develop in a very specific environment. It\r\n          cannot live without that condition. We can stop development of\r\n          parasites if we could make our body healthy by taking appropriate food\r\n          and cleansing therapy. We should cleanse colon and parasites, take\r\n          healthy food, say a big 'NO' to junk food, wash hands before taking\r\n          food, after using washroom and after changing diapers of children.\r\n          Parasites can be defeated by improving our hygiene habits; there is no\r\n          second opinion about it.\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Advantages of pulsar, Zapper and colloidal silver</strong>\r\n            Pulsar, Zapper and colloidal silver not only help you get rid of\r\n            parasites, but also help you get over diseases caused by them and\r\n            achieve following positive changes in our body:  Quick relief from\r\n            acnes  Improved movements of joints  Relief from chronic pain \r\n            Quick recovery from burn-cut wounds etc.  Tapeworm in stool after a\r\n            week's time  Improvement in respiratory and sinus process  Body pH\r\n            level balance (in most of the cases)  Reduction in redness of eyes\r\n             Recovery from flue and cold and cough  Cleansing of metals and\r\n            toxins deposited in body  Positive feeling, clear thinking and deep\r\n            sleep  Get rid of depression and migraine  Get rid of \"PMS\" means\r\n            pre-menstrual problems  Benefit in psoriasis  Relief from\r\n            ringworm, itching and shining skin  Relief in ear pain, tooth pain\r\n             Shrinking and elimination of tumor and warts  End of fungi such\r\n            as yeast and candida  Relief from dandruff  Relief in ulcer\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Clearing the doubts / FAQs</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>1. Is use of Zapper fully safe?</strong>\r\n            Yes, it is safe; but pregnant ladies and people with pacemakers\r\n            should avoid use of Zapper. In the initial days of using Zapper, one\r\n            might not feel well because of cleansing of parasites, but you will\r\n            be okay in an hour or two.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>2. Can one feel electric shock while using Zapper?</strong>\r\n          No one feels shock with a 9-volt battery or power supplied with the\r\n          help of an adopter (here input voltage is 9 volt and output voltage\r\n          lowers further).\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>3. What is the right time to use Zapper?</strong>You can use\r\n          Zapper anytime as per your convenience.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            4. What to do when copper pipers (which we hold during zapping) gets\r\n            black?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          Their blackening is natural. It does not affect the zapping process\r\n          and causes no harm at all. You can clean them with Scotch Brite (or\r\n          any other scrub) and soap.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            5. Can copper pipes be held in any hand during zapping or there is\r\n            some specific way to hold them?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          You can start zapping by holding any pipe in any hand. Also, you have\r\n          to keep interchanging copper pipes between two hands. Just note that\r\n          both the pipes must not touch each other once the power switch is on.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            6. In your view, is it appropriate to use Zapper, pulsar, and\r\n            colloidal silver together for two weeks?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          I believe it to be appropriate and for better results, one must\r\n          cleanse kidney and acidities before using them. Then cleanse parasites\r\n          and, it is more than better if you could cleanse liver too immediately\r\n          after cleansing of parasites. After two weeks you will feel like a\r\n          young lad full of energy instead of the old tired person. One more\r\n          thing, when you use both Zapper and pulsar together, then one week\r\n          course is sufficient instead of two.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            7. Will it impact negatively on my health if I use Zapper, pulsar\r\n            more than the time you recommend?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          There is no harm in regular use of Zapper, pulsar. But it costs extra\r\n          money and time; which everyone lacks. That is why I never advise the\r\n          regular use of Zapper. And you don't need that. Once parasites have\r\n          been destroyed, re-germination takes time. In such a situation, you\r\n          can repeat it when you need it. Yes, you can keep taking colloidal\r\n          silver water regularly after some break.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>8. Can I use Zapper while cleansing kidney or liver?</strong>\r\n          Of course, and you will get better results by cleansing complete\r\n          parasites before cleansing the liver.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>9. I have a zapper. Can it also be used as a pulsar?</strong>\r\n          Zapper and pulsar are two different instruments with different\r\n          functions. They work on different frequencies. Their input current is\r\n          different. Their output waves are also different. They, of course, are\r\n          complementary to each other. However, now Indian Zapper Deluxe is\r\n          offering pulsar and Zapper and colloidal silver in one instrument.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            10. Can I use distilled water to prepare colloidal silver water?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          You can use distilled water, but it is not going to serve any specific\r\n          benefit. Be it tab water, purified water or mineral water or spring\r\n          water – all are equally suitable for preparing colloidal silver water.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            11. What is the life of silver rods used in making colloidal water?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          It depends upon the method of preparing colloidal silver water.\r\n          However, one pair of 5-6 inch silver rod can make approx. 5000 glass\r\n          of silver water.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            12. Do we mix salt while preparing colloidal silver water?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          Don't mix anything while preparing colloidal silver water, salt never.\r\n          Mixing salt can, of course, hasten the process of colloidal silver,\r\n          but it adds many impurities in the water, which diminish the impact of\r\n          colloidal silver.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            13. What is the right method of making colloidal silver water?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          During the process, keep the colloidal silver maker on until water\r\n          becomes cloudy white. It takes approx. 10 to 20 minutes in it.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            14. How much colloidal silver should I make in one attempt?\r\n          </strong>\r\n          There is no limit. You can make as much colloidal silver as you want.\r\n          Generally, people make only one glass of silver water in one attempt,\r\n          divide it in four doses and finish it during the day.
